From April 2024, I am an **Assistant Professor** ([Lecturer](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/65cgfc/doctor-han-wu){:target="_blank"}) in the School of Electronics & Computer Science ([ECS](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/about/faculties-schools-departments/school-of-electronics-and-computer-science){:target="_blank"}) at the University of Southampton. My position is anchored within the [Cyber Security group](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/research/institutes-centres/cyber-security){:target="_blank"}, where I am deeply engaged in addressing research challenges in the realm of Dependable and Secure Machine Learning Technology.

📣📣📣 🎓 **<span style="color:tomato">PhD Opportunities</span> at [ECS, University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/about/faculties-schools-departments/school-of-electronics-and-computer-science){:target="_blank"}** 🇬🇧🎓 Prospective students who are interested in privacy-preserving machine learning and cyber security, please contact me via [email]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/contact.md %}). For research topics, please refer to [this]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/research.md %}) brief introduction or [the post](https://www.jobs.ac.uk/job/DJX190/phd-studentship-privacy-security-risks-in-machine-federated-learning-systems){:target="_blank"}. Visiting students are also welcome to apply.

My research interests are broad and encompass a variety of key areas, including **Federated Learning**, **Inference Attacks**, **Differential Privacy**, **Tabular Data Synthesis**, and **Machine Unlearning**. My work aims to contribute to the advancement of secure and reliable machine learning systems that can be trusted in sensitive and critical applications.

Prior to joining SOTON, I was a Research Fellow (2023-2024) in the School of Computer Science at University of Birmingham. In this role, I worked with [Prof. Aad van Moorsel](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=FawbTj8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao){:target="_blank"} on the EPSRC-funded [AGENCY](https://agencyresearch.net/){:target="_blank"} (£ 2.7M) project. I also worked as a Research Associate (2021-2023) for the EPSRC-funded [FinTrust](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FR033595%2F1){:target="_blank"} (£ 1.0M) project at Newcastle University. I am the awardee of the [Post-Doctoral Enrichment Award 2022](https://www.turing.ac.uk/post-doctoral-enrichment-awards-pdea){:target="_blank"} granted by the Alan Turing Institute.

I obtained PhD degree in Computer Science from the Free University of Berlin in 2020. My PhD supervisor is [Prof. Katinka Wolter](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=JqtocLYAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}. I received my Bachelor's degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in 2013, and Master's degree from Tongji University in 2016.
