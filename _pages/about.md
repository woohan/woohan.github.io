From April 2024, I am an **Assistant Professor** ([Lecturer](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/65cgfc/doctor-han-wu){:target="_blank"}) in the School of Electronics & Computer Science ([ECS](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/about/faculties-schools-departments/school-of-electronics-and-computer-science){:target="_blank"}) at the University of Southampton. I am part of the [Cyber Security group](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/research/institutes-centres/cyber-security){:target="_blank"}, focusing on **Dependable and Secure Machine Learning Technology**. My research spans Federated Learning, Inference Attacks, Differential Privacy, Tabular Data Synthesis, and Machine Unlearning, aiming to advance secure and reliable machine learning systems for sensitive applications.

For research topics, please refer to [this]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/research.md %}) brief introduction or [the post](https://www.jobs.ac.uk/job/DJX190/phd-studentship-privacy-security-risks-in-machine-federated-learning-systems){:target="_blank"}. Visiting students are also welcome to apply.

Prior to joining SOTON, I was a Research Fellow (2023-2024) in the School of Computer Science at University of Birmingham. In this role, I worked with [Prof. Aad van Moorsel](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=FawbTj8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao){:target="_blank"} on the EPSRC-funded [AGENCY](https://agencyresearch.net/){:target="_blank"} (Â£ 2.7M) project. I also worked as a Research Associate (2021-2023) for the EPSRC-funded [FinTrust](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FR033595%2F1){:target="_blank"} (Â£ 1.0M) project at Newcastle University. I am the awardee of the [Post-Doctoral Enrichment Award 2022](https://www.turing.ac.uk/post-doctoral-enrichment-awards-pdea){:target="_blank"} granted by the Alan Turing Institute.

I obtained PhD degree in Computer Science from the Free University of Berlin in 2020. My PhD supervisor is [Prof. Katinka Wolter](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=JqtocLYAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}. I received my Bachelor's degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in 2013, and Master's degree from Tongji University in 2016.
